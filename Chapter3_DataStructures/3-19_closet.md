If I had a closet full of shirts I'm assuming I have access to coat hangers and then it's kind of like an instant O(1) access of an index from the side. Plus I can pick whatever shirt I want. 

If I don't have coat hangers and have to fold them and stack them then that limits me to the top of the pile and I'd have to shuffle them around to get to the other shirts...not as ideal.
