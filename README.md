# The Algorithm Design Manual

This repository contains my notes and personal solutions to the textbook problems in the form of writing and code that I have composed while reading through Steven Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd edition.

## What is this for?
I'm reading a little bit of this textbook and doing some problems out of it every once in a while. Thought maybe having this repo 
up on Github would serve as some external motivation. 

So far I'd say I've only really chewed on problems from Chapter 3 and 5 (Basic DS and Graphs). The other chapters are woefully sparse. I apologize. This takes me time...! 

### Unrelated thoughts
Kind of annoyed that chapter 5 on the Algorist wiki is locked to contributors. Got excited about contributing a solution and discovered the page was locked down--wonder how many excited beaming hearts like mine were broken from that.
