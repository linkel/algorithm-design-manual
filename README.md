# The Algorithm Design Manual

This repository contains my notes and personal solutions to the textbook problems in the form of writing and code that I have composed while reading through Steven Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd edition.

## What is this for?
I'm reading a little bit of this textbook and doing some problems out of it every once in a while. Thought maybe having this repo 
up on Github would serve as some external motivation.
